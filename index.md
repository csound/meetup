# Online Csound meetup

## Important dates

Date of the meetup: May 30th, 2020, 9am PDT (16h UTC).

Date for submitting a proposal: May 23th, 2020, noon PDT (19h UTC).

## The story behind this meetup...

We want to have a casual meetup for Csound users - and you are invited!

This friendly, informal meetup will be held on May 30th 2020, on the Internet, starting at 9am PDT.

### Submit a talk!
We want to have interesting talks, for different levels of expertise and from different backgrounds -
please submit your idea for a presentation before this Saturday May 23th, noon PDT (19h UTC).

Your presentation can be about any Csound-related topic.
As general examples, here are some of our ideas: you could showcase a work of yours and talk about the csound
concepts involved in it, do a small livecoding session to demonstrate a novel usecase,
or talk about creating new instruments in Csound.

We are planning on having 3-4 talks, of about 10-15 minutes each - for an hour long meetup.

Please send the proposals to [finartcialist at gmail] or find us on Slack if you have any question.

Thank you for your interest - and thanks to Steven Yi for helping me give shape to this idea.

See you in the Slack #meetup channel !

Stay home, stay safe ðŸŒˆ
